# Royal Remedy

This was our entry for the 2024 Utah Indie Game Jam Entry. 

I made this with my son Nathan Worthington and friend Jim Byer.  It is based on the game of Mastermind.  it is a puzzle game where you are supposed to guess the colors and order of the colors based on clues.  

The theme of the game jam was "Double Agent".  In this case, will you be blamed of being the double agent, or will you find the cure for the king in time?
